# MIT OpenCourseWare RSS feed generator

Simple script to read [MIT OpenCourseWare](http://ocw.mit.edu/index.htm) XML files and generate a RSS feed that's compatible with podcast apps, like Pocket Casts.

So far there's only one, if it works well I'll probably generate more, if you want one let me know through GitHub issues, it should be easy to create others if the XML file follows the same format.

I'll publish the RSS feeds on http://geekout.fm/mit/, here's the list of the available ones:
* [Game Design - Philip B. Tan, Richard Eberhardt - CMS.608 - Spring 2014](http://ocw.mit.edu/courses/comparative-media-studies-writing/cms-608-game-design-spring-2014/index.htm)

## Contributing

This is a quick hack, it isn't suposed to live long. To add more courses just copy `generate_rss_for_` function and change the proper details.
